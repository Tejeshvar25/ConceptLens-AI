# ConceptLens – AI Concept Dependency Mapper

## 1. Project Overview
ConceptLens is an AI-powered learning intelligence system designed to identify broken prerequisite knowledge chains in students. The system maps subject concepts into a structured dependency graph and detects weak foundational nodes to improve structured learning.

## 2. Problem Statement
Students often struggle with advanced topics due to weak understanding of prerequisite concepts. Existing learning platforms track overall marks but fail to diagnose root-cause conceptual gaps. This leads to inefficient learning and repeated academic failure.

## 3. Objectives
- Build a structured Concept Dependency Graph.
- Track mastery score at individual concept level.
- Detect weak prerequisite knowledge.
- Recommend structured revision paths.
- Improve learning productivity through intelligent analysis.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- User authentication system.
- Quiz/assessment module.
- Concept tagging for each question.
- Concept-level mastery score calculation.
- Dependency gap detection mechanism.
- Recommendation engine for revision.
- Student dashboard with visual concept graph.
- Faculty analytics dashboard (optional).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalable cloud-native architecture.
- Secure authentication and data storage.
- Fast response time for real-time feedback.
- High availability and reliability.
- Cost-efficient deployment using serverless infrastructure.

## 6. Target Users
- College students
- Faculty members
- Educational institutions

## 7. Expected Outcomes
- Improved concept mastery levels.
- Reduced foundational learning gaps.
- Structured and scientific learning progression.
